# Simple tests on SQRT and INV_SQRT approximations
Just to test the error percentage and the speedup against stdlib implementation.

## Description
See the following output of the program that contains more information and the results. <br>

===========
Simple tests of sqrt() approximation and inv_sqrt() Quake III approximation 
in float32. 

Currently there are SIMD instructions to calculate SQRT() and INV_SQRT() 
that are faster then this approximations, but for embedded systems this 
this optimizations give a real boost in performance. 

Tested on x86_64 AMD Ryzen 7 2700,  Linux in GCC with optimization flags -O3
